# Starling
This repo contains the following features:

For build,
1. Build disk-based graph index.
1. Build in-memory navigation graph, based on
    1. Nodes that are uniformly-sampled.
    1. Nodes that are generated by search frequency.
1. Perform Block shuffling on the disk-based graph

For search,

|             |  With Cache Nodes  |   With Nav Graph   | With Block Shuffling |  With Block Pruning  |       Use SQ       |

## Quick Start

To install dependencies, run 

```bash
apt install build-essential libboost-all-dev make cmake g++ libaio-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev clang-format libboost-all-dev libmkl-full-dev
```


To run benchmarks, go to `scripts` directory, copy `config_sample.sh` to `config_local.sh` and run

```bash
./run_benchmark.sh [debug/release] [build/build_mem/search] [knn/range]
```

Configure datasets and parameters in `config_local.sh`
